Description: a bitcoin implementation on an FPGA

-Communication between the FPGA and the host computer is through a serial port


-TODO:

4/11/2011:
	-Verify the UART is working at 9600 baud 
		-toggle LED based on receiving data
		-toggle LED when a specific byte is received
		-return a byte back to the host
	-Build a "input handler" module
		-this will wrap around the UART input component, will parse all the 
		information in an easy to digest format for the controller
	-Build a "output handler" module
		-this will wrap around the UART output component, will receive commands and data in a buffer, this data will be shifted out a byte at a time to the host
	-Build the "SHA256 Controller"
		-read formatted data from the "input handler"
		-execute commands received from the host
		-sends an "I'm alive" pulse every 1 second
		-if any match has been found this response is sent to "output handler"

	-Give credit to the uart module we used from OpenCores.org
	-Give credit to the SHA256 module we used from OpenCores.org
